# CryptoTracker
Basic project implementing MVVM architecture with Paging Library 3 to load and cache remote data with Room.

To build and run the project one would need to add apikey.properties file in the root of the project with a single string parameter "COINMARKETCAP_KEY". 
CoinMarketCap provides basic keys. Documentation which explains how to get it can be found here https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/
